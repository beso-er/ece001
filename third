      <td>The use of customer data invariably raises privacy issues. By uncovering hidden connections between seemingly unrelated pieces of data, big data analytics could potentially reveal sensitive personal information. Research indicates that 62% of bankers are cautious in their use of big data due to privacy issues. Further, outsourcing of data analysis activities or distribution of customer data across departments for the generation of richer insights also amplifies security risks. Such as customersâ€™ earnings, savings, mortgages, and insurance policies ended up in the wrong hands. Such incidents reinforce concerns about data privacy and discourage customers from sharing personal information in exchange for customized offers.</td>

Users of I Phone and Android smartphones have applications at their fingertips that use facial recognition technology for various tasks. For example, Android users with the remember app can snap a photo of someone, then bring up stored information about that person based on their image when their own memory lets them down a potential boon for salespeople. </td>
